>One of Seluvis's favorite puppets.
>Use to summon the spirit of Nepheli Loux.
>Puppet of a warrior who was betrayed by her pure heart. Wields a Stormhawk Axe in both hands and uses the Thunderstorm skill.
>A diamond in the rough, deserving of special care lest its potential be squandered. Nepheli Loux truly was a warrior.
