**Introduction**
>O-oh!
>Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship...
>I-I apologise for any offence given.
>I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family.
>I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls.

**Visit**
>Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use.
>Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom.
>Why not pick something out, before you go?
>But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia...
>A little something by way of compensation?
