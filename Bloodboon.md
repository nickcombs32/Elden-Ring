>Sacred incantation of Mohg, Lord of Blood.
>Thrust arm into the body of the Formless Mother, then scatter the bloodflame to set the area ablaze.
>This incantation can be cast while in motion.
>The mother of truth craves wounds. When Mohg stood before her, deep underground, his accursed blood erupted with fire, and besotted with the defilement that he was born into.
