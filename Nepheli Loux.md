### Dialogue
**Introduction**
>Be proud. You were a fine warrior.
>Your only mistake was your choice of master.
>Let the winds lift you, to a higher place.

**When attacked**
>I see. You are but a simple villain. Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!
>(On player kill) You wouldn't even register as a threat to father. Hurry up and die.

**When killed**
>Father... I am slain. Please...become Elden Lord...

**Speaking to Nepheli**
>Well, who do we have here?
>Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.
>I am Nepehli Loux.. Tarnished and warrior, like you.
>I'm here by decree of my father.
>How utterly repellant this is...
>This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.
>He's tainted the very winds."
>If you intend to challenge Godrick,
>I ask you call upon me.
>The winds run could with his deeds.
>I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.

**Small Talk**
>Apologies, but I've idled long enough.
>As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance. Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.

**At the Roundtable**
>You again...
>I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.
>Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
>I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.
>I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.
>You defeated him. You should have it. Make good use of it. I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.
>(Hands you x1 Arsenal Charm)
>Ah yes. I wonder if you've met my foster father?
>He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.
>If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.
>Father is the leader of the Roundtable.
>I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while.
>It's about time I headed off.
>I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it.

**At the Village of the Albinaurics**
>Oh, it's you... Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?
>I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.
>The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.
>A waking nightmare, made by men.
>But this time, I'm a woman grown.
>And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.
>Justice to the oppressors.
>Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux, Warrior.

**At the Roundtable Hold after defeating the boss of the Village of the Albinaurics**
>Ah, you... Please, leave me be. It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.
>(After speaking to Gideon)
>..So you know already, do you? Right. It's true. My father cast me out.
>For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.
>Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.
>I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.
>And yet I... Though it was not my intent... I betrayed him...
>I...can no longer trust in father... To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy... Where is the justice he purports, in that?
>He once told me that if he became Elden Lord, he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.
>Was he simply lying to me?
>No, no, no... How could I say that? Father has always given me his guidance... And now...I've lost it...

**After giving her the Stormhawk King**
>In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.
>It reminds me of my first hawk.
>I'm... not like Roderika. I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.
>Still, this ash... It reminds me of my first hawk. Thank you

**At Stormveil Castle throne room**
>It's been some time. I must thank you, for your aid.
>I told father I would be with him no longer.
>I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.
>This land is much like the one from which I hail.
>I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.
>Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
>Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.
>Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.
>I cannot express how much you've helped me.
>(Hands you x1 Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone)
>Should you become Elden Lord. I would gladly lighten your burden.
>Farewell, fellow warrior. I will remain, to summon the storm.
>But your guidance, and your fight... Surely lie elsewhere.
