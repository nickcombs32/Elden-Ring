### Dialogue
**Introduction**
>Greetings. Traveller from beyond the fog. I am Melina. I offer you an accord.
>Have you heard of the finger maidens? 
>They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished.
>But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. 
>I can play the role of maiden. Turning rune fragments into strength. 
>To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. 
>You need only take me with you. To the foot of the Erdtree.

**If Accepting**
>Then its settled. Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. 
>Ahh, another matter. I bequeath to you this ring.
>(Hands over Spectral Steed Whistle)
>Use it to traverse great distances. It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. 
>Torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect.

**If Refusing**
>I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger. 
>Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.
>Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.
>Have you reconsidered my offer? (if talked to at a Site of Grace after your refusal)

**More on Melina**
>This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. 
>This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.
>But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. 
>The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.
>Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer. 
>A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.
>If the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you.
>As an ally by pact...I pray that you are fit...to face the challenge presented by the Ring.

**When Leveling Up**
>Shall I turn your runes to strength? Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
>Share them with me, your thoughts, your ambitions, the principles you would follow.
>Phew. It is done. (Version 1.0 only)

**Purpose**
>Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless.
>There is something for which I must apologize. I've acted the finger maiden yet I can offer no guidance, I am no maiden.
>My purpose was long ago lost...

**When resting at [[Third Church of Marika Site]]**
>Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well. Shall I share them with you?
>Very well. In Marika's own words. 
>My Lord, and thy warriors. 
>I divest each of thee of thy grace.
>With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. 
>Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.
>Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.

**When resting at [[Church of Pilgrimage Site]]**
>Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago. If you wish, I will share them with you.
>In Marika's own words.
>Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.
>Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.
>Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.

**When resting at the [[Grand Lift of Dectus Site]]**
>Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?
>In Marika's own words. 
>The Erdtree governs all. 
>The choice is thine.
>Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.
>To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.

**When resting at [[Altus Plateau]]**
>The Erdtree...is close. 
>Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled. 
>It takes me back. I was born at the foot of the Erdtree. Where mother gave me my purpose.
>Though now, everything is lost to me. 
>I...have to ascertain for myself. 
>The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.

**About [[Boc]]**
>Your seamster, Boc...
>I see him crying, from time to time.
>I think he misses his mother. He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful. 
>Does being born of a mother... mean one behaves in such a manner?

**When resting at the [[Capital Outskirts]]**
>Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?
>In Marika's own words. 
>Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved. 
>Make of thyselves that which ye desire. 
>Be it a Lord. Be it a God. 
>But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken. 
>Amounting only to sacrifices...

**When resting at the [[Queen's Bedchamber Site]] after defeating [[Morgott, the Omen King]]**
>Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?
>In Marika's own words. 
>O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. 
>Thou'rt yet to become me. 
>Thou'rt yet to become a god. 
>Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.

**When resting at [[Minor Erdtree Church Site]]**
>Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?
>In Marika's own words. 
>I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. 
>Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. 
>Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. 
>My comrades, why must ye falter?

**Upon encountering [[Margit, The Fell Omen]] or when first resting at a non-dungeon Site of Grace outside of [[Limgrave]]** 
>Forgive me. I've been...testing you. 
>To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.
>And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. 
>It seems my worries were unfounded.
>Torrent had your measure from the very start. 
>Whereas I merely pretended.
>There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.
>I can take you to the Roundtable Hold... 
>Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...
>Very well. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.

**Upon reaching [[East Rampart Site]]**
>My utmost thanks. 
>For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree. 
>Here, I can govern my own movement. 
>And thus, the accord is fullfiled. 
>I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given. 
>Farewell. 
>I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. 
>I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. 
>You have fought long and hard. 
>I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. 
>May you take the throne.

**When being unable to enter the Erdtree, she appears at the near site of grace.**
>Hello again, old friend. Allow me a moment to converse with you. 
>You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no? 
>Prevented by the mantle of barbs. The thorns are impenetrable. 
>A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without. 
>The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns. 
>My purpose serves to aid in that very act. 
>So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me.
>To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snow mountaintops of the giants. 
>Then I can set the Erdtree aflame. And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. (She gives the player a Rold Medallion and makes a red mark on the map.)

**Upon resting at [[Cathedral of the Forsaken Site]]**
> If you intend to claim the Frenzied Flame, I ask that you cease. 
> It is not to be meddled with. 
> It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. 
> However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair, life endures. 
> Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? 
> If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.
> Please, leave the Frenzied Flame alone.

**Upon resting at [[Frenzied Flame Proscription Site]]**
>I ask you, one more time. Please, seek not the Frenzied Flame. As one who strives to become a Lord, deny not the lives, the new births of this world. Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. When the land they preside over is lifeless.
>Please put a stop to this madness. The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. When the land they preside over is lifeless.

**After speaking to [[Enia]] about burning the thorns**
>Think not, of the kindling. I shall see to that.
>All I ask of you is to make the journey.
>To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.
>I know... I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.
>But it must be done to reach the path beyond.
>And that is the path I wish to travel.
>What is your mind?

**Upon resting at the [[Snow Valley Ruins Overlook Site]]**
>There is something I'd like to say. 
>My purpose was given to me by my mother. 
>But now, I act of my own volition.
>I have set my heart upon the world that I would have. 
>Regardless of my mother's designs.
>I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that. Not even you.

**When resting at [[First Church of Marika Site]]**
>Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?
>In Marika's own words. 
>Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. 
>Guidance has delivered ye through ordeal to the place ye stand. 
>Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame atop the mount. 
>Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. 
>Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!
>We are almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. 
>I'm glad it was you I traveled with. 
>I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. 
>Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.

**Upon resting at [[Giants' Gravepost Site]]**
>We're almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. 
>I'm glad it was you I travelled with. 
>I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. 
>Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.

**Upon resting at [[Forge of the Giants Site]]**
>I have long observed the Lands Between.
>This world is in dire need of repair...
>and Death...indiscriminate...
>Are you prepared...
>To commit a cardinal sin?
>(Answering "I'd like you to wait")
>Very well.
>Tell me, when you are fully prepared.
>(Answering "I'm Ready")
>Very well.
>Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
>(A cinematic of Melina igniting the forge)
>O Erdtree, you shall burn.
>Burn, for the sake of the new Lord.
>(Turns back at you)
>Thank you. For guiding me here.
>(Lifts hand and ignites more intensely)
>The one who walks alongside flame, 
>Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.
>Good-bye.

**Upon resting at any site after having inherited the Frenzied Flame**
>You... have inherited the Frenzied Flame. 
>A pity. You are no longer fit. 
>Our journey together ends here. And remember... 
>Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos, I will kill you, as sure as night follows day. 
>Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes. 
>Goodbye, my companion. 
>Goodbye, Torrent...

**"Lord of Frenzied Flame" ending cutscene**
>Lord of Frenzied Flame... 
>I will seek you, as far as you may travel... 
>To deliver you what is yours. 
>Destined Death.
