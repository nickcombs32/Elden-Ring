### Lineage
Misbegotten
### Location
[[Roundtable Hold]]
### Dialogue
**Introduction**
>You're a new face. No matter, it's all the same.
>Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.

**About the chains on your legs**
>I see you've noticed the chains. Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains.
>I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. That's all there is to it.

**You're a prisoner?**
>Nah, don't read too much into it. I've no grudge against you.
>My being a prisoner is no fault of yours. Besides, I don't mind smithing.
>Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same.
>Given time, technique never fails. Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her...

**Prayer**
>Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. The road is yet long. A God is not easily felled. But one day, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...

**While caught praying**
>Ah, You, is it? I...didn't notice you there.
>I'll be doing my job, same as ever. Just lay out your arms.

**About the prayer**
>Those words were not meant for you. I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.
>But my prayers are mine and mine alone. Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too.

**When asked about [[Roderika]]**
>The girl you brought here...
>She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade, but she has a gift for spirit tuning.
>I saw another one like her, long ago. Their eyes share the same hue.

**After speaking to [[Roderika]]**
>The girl? What about her?

**Would you watch over [[Roderika]]?** 
>Are you out of your mind?
>Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?
>Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it.

**It's what she wants**
>I refuse to believe it. I don't doubt you,
>but I know when something's too good to be true.

**After speaking to [[Roderika]] again**
>I spoke with the girl. She has a gift for spirit tuning. So I told her everything I know.
>I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. It was all I could do to honour her.
>I'm sorry I doubted you.

**After defeating [[Godrick The Grafted]]**
>Now, look at you. Those eyes tell a story. Of a challenger, who's felled her mark.
>Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms.

**Interaction while smithing**
>Well, where've you been hiding? I took you for dead.
>No matter. It's all the same. Lay out your arms, then.

**After defeating [[Godskin Duo]]**
>I'll smith... as long as you like
>Now ...lay out your ...arms

**After arriving in [[Leyndell, Royal Capital]]**
>No, no, no, no...
>I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.
>I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!
>Oh, it's you.
>Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.
>Just lay out your arms.

**About [[Roderika]] (after her dialogue about becoming a certified spirit tuner)**
>The girl has come a long way.
>As ever, time and technique have made her stronger. Tis good to see.
>An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.
>But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.
>I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.

**After refusing [[Melina]]'s request at the [[Forge of the Giants Site]]**
>Are you having second thoughts? Might I have a word, then?
>Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.
>The demigods. And their god.
>If you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,
>I will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god.

After the cutscene at the Forge of the Giants

I knew you'd be back. Lay out your arms. Let's get to smithing.
Weren't you listening? As I've always said. You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.
And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.
It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.
After speaking to Roderika again

I've upset the girl. She says that now my chains are broken, I'm free. That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.
What use have I for freedom now? I smith weapons to slay a god. I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.
Is there any other way?
§About the god-slaying weapon

Use my masterpiece to slay a god. That is all that I have lived for.
And my promise to Q-queen Marika. But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.
I can't hold on much longer. I'm going the way of the R-roundtable... It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.
Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends. My lord, f-for that is what you are.
§After completing Crumbling Farum Azula

Who are you? Oh, I must be a blacksmith. Now, let's get smithing...
Could you tell me what happened? Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?
Why does that girl weep for me? Have I forgotten something of dire importance?
